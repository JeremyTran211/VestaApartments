# Milestones Folder

## This folder is used to store all the necessary documents for each milestone. Each milestone folder (with the only exception of milestone5 folder) will contain two milestone documents plus their prototypes (if any). The first version of each milestone is your original submission (version 1). After the instructor feedback, teams will have to create an additional document (version 2) to revise the feedback from the instructor given for that specific milestone. Milestone 5 folder will contain only one document; M5.pdf
